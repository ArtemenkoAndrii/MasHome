    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This privacy notice for <strong>Andrii Artemenko</strong> ("we", "us", "our") describes how and why we might collect, store, use, and process your information when you use our services ("Services"), such as when you:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Download and use our mobile application (<strong>Mas Money</strong>) or any other application of ours that links to this privacy notice.</li>
        <li>Engage with us in other related ways, including any sales, marketing, or events.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We built the "<strong>Mas Money</strong>" app as a free app. This application is provided by us at no cost and is intended for use as is. If you choose to use this application, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
        The Mas Money app collects and stores all user-entered data on the user's device only and does not transfer it to any other servers or devices, nor does it share it with any third parties. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For more efficient use of the application, the user may allow the application to capture SMS messages and Push Notifications. These will be collected and processed the same way as user-entered data (not shared and not distributed with anyone).
    </p>

    <h2>3. Application Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        In order to use the application as efficiently as possible, the user may grant the following permissions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS</strong> – to allow the application to capture SMS messages.</li>
        <li><strong>android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES</strong> – to allow Mas Money to read the name of a Push Notification sender.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To activate the ability to capture Push Notifications, it is also necessary to allow "<strong>Device & app notifications</strong>" permission in the "<strong>Special app access</strong>" section.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Information Safety</h2>
    <p>
        We have organizational and technical processes and procedures in place to protect your personal information. However, no electronic transmission over the internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
    </p>

        We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "<strong>Revised</strong>" date, and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible.
    </p>
    <p>
        If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification.
    </p>
    <p>
        We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information. This policy is effective as of <strong>November 7, 2022</strong>.
