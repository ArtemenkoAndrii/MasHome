                         Privacy Policy  
                         --------------  

1. Introduction  

   This privacy notice for Andrii Artemenko ("we", "us", "our") describes  
   how and why we might collect, store, use, and process your information  
   when you use our services ("Services"), such as when you:  

   - Download and use our mobile application (Mas Money) or any other  
     application of ours that links to this privacy notice.  

   - Engage with us in other related ways, including any sales, marketing,  
     or events.  

   We built the "Mas Money" app as a free app. This application is provided  
   by us at no cost and is intended for use as is. If you choose to use this  
   application, then you agree to the collection and use of information in  
   relation to this policy.  

2. Information Collection and Use  

   The Mas Money app collects and stores all user-entered data on the user's  
   device only and does not transfer it to any other servers or devices, nor  
   does it share it with any third parties.  

   For more efficient use of the application, the user may allow the  
   application to capture SMS messages and Push Notifications. These will be  
   collected and processed the same way as user-entered data (not shared and  
   not distributed with anyone).  

3. Application Permissions  

   In order to use the application as efficiently as possible, the user may  
   grant the following permissions:  

   - **android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS** – to allow the application to capture  
     SMS messages.  

   - **android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES** – to allow Mas Money to read  
     the name of a Push Notification sender.  

   To activate the ability to capture Push Notifications, it is also necessary  
   to allow "Device & app notifications" permission in the "Special app access"  
   section.  

4. Information Safety  

   We have organizational and technical processes and procedures in place to  
   protect your personal information. However, no electronic transmission over  
   the internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%  
   secure. Therefore, we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,  
   cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to  
   defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your  
   information.  

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy  

   We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version  
   will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date, and the updated version will  
   be effective as soon as it is accessible.  

   If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either  
   by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you  
   a notification.  

   We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of  
   how we are protecting your information. This policy is effective as of  
   November 7, 2022.
